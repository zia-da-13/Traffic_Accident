<h1>Traffic Accident Dataset</h1>

This dataset contains detailed records of traffic accidents reported by the <ins>Metro Police Department of Nashville</ins>, including vehicle counts, injuries, fatalities, and contributing factors. The data focuses on accidents within the Nashville metropolitan area and provides insights into accident trends, including weather conditions, hit-and-run cases, and illumination conditions.
Data Source
The dataset was obtained from traffic accident reports compiled by the **Metro Police Department of Nashville**.
 
  Dataset Overview
• Total Records: 245,286
• Total Columns: 27
• File Format: CSV




# Motivation 
I chose this Project because of the increasing relevance of traffic safety in rapidly growing urban areas like Nashville and around the city. The city has experienced significant population growth and economic development, leading to more vehicles on the road and a corresponding rise in traffic-related incidents. Personally, as an Uber driver, I have firsthand experience with the challenges of navigating traffic in busy city areas and vital number of accidents while on the job has given me a unique perspective on the importance of road safety and the factors that contribute to unsafe conditions.
Another driving factor for selecting this project is the opportunity to apply analytical techniques to a dataset that combines environmental, temporal, and human factors. With so many variables to consider—such as weather conditions, time of day, and collision types—this analysis provides a comprehensive way to highlight my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation. Additionally, traffic accidents impact not only individuals but also communities, making this analysis valuable for policy recommendations and urban planning efforts.
Lastly, the dataset’s richness and complexity offer a unique challenge. It allows me to practice integrating multiple fields of knowledge, from geographic analysis to statistical modeling, and to produce meaningful insights that could inform decision-making processes. Addressing such a multifaceted issue aligns well with my academic and professional goals.

# Technologies Used
To analyze Traffic_Accident dataset, I utilized a combination of powerful technologies and tools to offer extensive exploration and meaningful insights. I began with Jupyter Notebook 7.2, where I utilized Python for extensive data exploration and analysis through its powerful libraries to clean, transform, and analyze the dataset effectively. In order to gain a better understanding of the data, I used Microsoft Excel for initial data visualization and further analysis, creating charts and tables that highlighted significant trends and patterns. Finally, I used Power BI to create an interactive presentation that provided more meaningful explanations of the data. This dynamic dashboard not only showed the findings in graphical terms but also supported dynamic interaction with the data so that it is easier to deduce actionable insight and present the same in a compelling manner.


# Problems/Hurdles

During the work on the Traffic_Accident dataset, I encountered difficulties in data preprocessing and cleaning because of missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers. Comprehending intricate data relationships with limited experience in data analysis also meant learning sophisticated Python methods. Moreover, combining data from Jupyter Notebook, Excel, and Power BI required meticulous handling to ensure consistency. Interactive Power BI dashboard design was tricky from the standpoint of optimizing performance as well as determining appropriate visual objects for effective storytelling. Getting past these obstacles required intense research, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

# Usage

This dataset can be used for:
- **Accident trend analysis** (pre-COVID vs. post-COVID comparisons)
- **Traffic safety research** and identifying high-risk areas
- **Predictive modeling** for accident likelihood based on weather, time, and location
- **Policy-making** for road safety improvements in Nashville
